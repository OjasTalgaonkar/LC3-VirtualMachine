# LC3 Virtual Machine

This project is my practice project for starting out with C++

The LC3 or Little Computer 3 is an old computer architecture with minimal commands. 

I built this with the help of this website
https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/#implementing-instructions




## Documentation




## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/OjasTalgaonkar/LC3-VirtualMachine.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd LC3-VirtualMachine
```



Run 2048 on the VM

```bash
  cd ..\assambledGames
  ..\src\lc3_vm 2048.obj

```

You can also run any other games that are assembled for the LC3 by replacing the path.
